## Introduction

Web services are a standardized way for developing interoperable applications i.e enabling an application to invoke a method of another application.
These applications can be on the same computer or different computers. Web services use open standards and protocols like HTTP, XML and SOAP.
Since these are open and well known protocols, applications built on any platform can interoperate with web services.
For example, a JAVA application can interoperate with a web service built using .NET.
Similarly a web service built using JAVA can be consumed by a .NET application.
